# Hackerearth HSBC ML Hackathon submission #

This repository is intended for learning purposes. This very basic code was written by me as a beginner in this field. Feel free to use it (if you are a beginner) or improve it (pro, ofcourse).

- Visit [HSBC ML 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashisparida/hsbc-ml-hackathon-2023) for the datasets.
- The code is written in python jupyter notebook.
- No information available for any of the variables in the datasets.
- You can use any model you want, don't hesitate to experiment.
- The actual output is not available as of now. 

## Codefile information ##

- The final model is derived in the model.ipynb notebook.
- Use model_train_helper.ipynb for getting a rough idea about clustering and creating additional features.
